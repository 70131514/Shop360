Documentation Note: Node.js Utility Scripts for Test Case Management

To streamline the test case documentation process, Node.js utility scripts were 
developed to automate the annotation and organization of test case specifications. 
These scripts processed markdown files to:

1. Automatically annotate test cases with implementation status by analyzing the codebase
   - Script: scripts/annotate-testcasespecs.js
   - Purpose: Adds "Implemented in code" status to each test case by mapping functional 
     requirements to actual code implementations (services, screens, components)
   - Output: Annotated test case specifications with implementation evidence

2. Filter test cases to maintain one positive and one negative test case per requirement
   - Script: scripts/filter-testcases.js
   - Purpose: Extracts the most important positive and negative test cases for each 
     functional/non-functional requirement from the comprehensive test case document
   - Output: Filtered test case document with essential test cases only

3. Organize state transition test cases based on functional requirements
   - Script: scripts/filter-state-transitions.js
   - Purpose: Filters and organizes state transition test cases to align with 
     specified functional requirements
   - Output: Organized state transition test case document

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- These scripts were used for documentation management and organization purposes only
- They did NOT execute actual test cases against the application
- They are utility tools for processing markdown documentation files
- The scripts analyze code structure and documentation to automate repetitive tasks
- All test case specifications were manually created; scripts only assisted in 
  organization and annotation

Technical Details:
- Language: Node.js (JavaScript)
- Dependencies: Built-in Node.js 'fs' module for file system operations
- Input: Markdown test case specification files
- Output: Processed and annotated markdown files
- Execution: Manual execution via command line (node script.js)
- Impact: No impact on application performance or build process
